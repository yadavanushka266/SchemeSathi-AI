SchemeSaathi AI — SIH26092
A working citizen prototype for AI-Driven Scheme Matching for Marginalized Entrepreneurs, based on the problem title and MoSJE context supplied by the team. This is a student project, not an official government service.

What works
React profile wizard and scheme results, backed by FastAPI.
653 catalogue records from the team's supplied CSV; explanations, benefits, document lists and official links.
Screening for age, income, gender, social category, disability, rural residence, business and state. SC and ST remain distinct.
State/district dropdowns from an offline NIC iGOD snapshot, refreshed 9 September 2026. A changed state clears the district; the server validates the pair.
Real citizen signup/login, hashed passwords, access tokens, SQLite persistence and staff authorization.
Chatbot with local keyword/TF-IDF retrieval and source-based answers. Gemini generation is optional.
Voice page with browser English speech and a Bhashini ASR → translation → scheme assistant → translation → TTS integration.
Customer care: private support tickets, staff replies, email and telephone links.
Explicit SMS opt-in/opt-out, staff campaign preview, and a disabled-by-default MSG91 adapter.
Production frontend build served by FastAPI, Docker image, persistent storage configuration and GitHub CI.
Screening is preliminary. The supplied eligibility table does not encode every scheme condition or confirm current availability. State is inferred from catalogue text for state schemes; ambiguous jurisdictions are excluded. A score measures recorded criteria, not approval probability. Read the official scheme guidelines before applying. The app does not file applications or approve benefits.

Start locally on Windows
Install Python 3.13 and Node.js 24. Open PowerShell in this repository.

python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pip install -r apps/backend/requirements.txt
npm.cmd --prefix apps/frontend ci
Copy-Item apps/backend/.env.example apps/backend/.env
Set a random JWT secret in apps/backend/.env (do not commit it). Generate one locally:

python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))"
Terminal 1:

cd apps/backend
../../.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m uvicorn src.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
Terminal 2, from the repository root:

npm.cmd --prefix apps/frontend run dev
Open http://localhost:5173. The Vite proxy connects to port 8000. Backend health: http://127.0.0.1:8000/health Development API docs: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/docs

To test the production frontend locally:

npm.cmd --prefix apps/frontend run build
Start/restart the backend after the build, then open http://127.0.0.1:8000. Direct navigation to the profile, results, chat and support pages works.

On Linux/macOS use .venv/bin/python, npm, and cp in place of the corresponding Windows commands.

Storage and accounts
The default database is apps/backend/schemesathi.db when the backend starts from its directory. Accounts, support tickets and SMS consent persist across restarts. Do not remove this file to reset a public service.

Wizard answers remain scoped to the current account in the browser. They are not a synchronized cloud profile. Access tokens are stored for the browser tab and expire after 30 minutes; sign in again when requested. Registration does not verify mobile/email ownership. Do not use this prototype as identity verification.

Create a staff account after starting the backend once:

cd apps/backend
../../.venv/Scripts/python.exe ../../scripts/create_staff.py
Enter the email, name and password in the terminal. Sign in with that account and open Support to view the helpdesk queue and outreach preview. Public registration always creates a citizen. No default admin password is shipped.

The inherited staff/telephony/OCR/outreach scaffolding is disabled by default via ENABLE_STAFF_API=false. The citizen helpdesk works independently. Keep that setting false for this prototype; enabling legacy routes requires separate review and infrastructure setup.

Customer care
Email: srivastava2722@gmail.com
Phone: +91 96530 31393
Website: Help & support → open a ticket and track the team's response.
Email and telephone links open the user's email/dialler. The application does not automatically send support emails and does not promise 24/7 staffing.

Bhashini voice setup
In the backend environment, configure:

BHASHINI_USER_ID=your-issued-user-id
BHASHINI_API_KEY=your-issued-api-key
BHASHINI_PIPELINE_ID=your-authorized-pipeline-id
Restart the backend. Open Voice assistant, choose Bhashini, select a language, record a question and stop. The browser creates mono 16-bit PCM WAV at 16 kHz. Recording is capped below 45 seconds. Microphone use requires HTTPS or localhost and permission.

The backend discovers task service IDs and the inference endpoint from the pipeline configuration. Language/model access depends on your provider account. Missing credentials or provider failures return an error, never a fake transcript or audio. Browser mode remains available in supporting browsers and uses English answers.

Live Bhashini calls have not been verified without the team's credentials. See Bhashini pipeline documentation.

SMS awareness setup
Obtain an MSG91 account and configure the sender and approved Indian SMS/DLT template with a website variable.
Configure the backend:
PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-live-site.example
MSG91_AUTH_KEY=your-provider-key
MSG91_TEMPLATE_ID=your-flow-template-id
MSG91_SENDER_ID=your-approved-sender
SMS_LIVE_ENABLED=false
Users sign in and choose Support → Opt in to SMS. They can opt out at any time.
Staff preview the campaign. Set SMS_LIVE_ENABLED=true only when ready to use the paid provider and approved template, then restart.
Staff click Send approved campaign. A request contains at most 100 eligible recipients. Provider acceptance is not delivery confirmation. Batches are reserved before sending to avoid duplicates; an uncertain provider result requires manual provider-log review, not an automatic retry.
No SMS was sent during development. The contact phone supplied by the team is customer care, not an automatically subscribed recipient. For a public rollout, add phone verification, delivery webhooks, campaign/audit records, operational retries and provider-compliant unsubscribe handling. Never upload an unsolicited contact list.

See MSG91 Flow API.

Optional Gemini
Set GEMINI_API_KEY and a model available to your account in CHATBOT_MODEL. The API key stays on the backend. Without it, chat uses local catalogue retrieval. Answers may be incomplete; verify official sources.

Tests
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pip install pytest
$env:PYTHONPATH='apps/backend'
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest apps/backend/tests -q
npm.cmd --prefix apps/frontend run lint
npm.cmd --prefix apps/frontend run build
For the browser test, build the frontend and run the backend on port 8000, then:

cd apps/frontend
npx.cmd playwright test
On Windows the test uses an isolated headless Microsoft Edge instance. On Linux install Playwright Chromium with npx playwright install --with-deps chromium. Tests create synthetic accounts and support tickets; use a test database for repeated browser runs.

Publish and host
GitHub stores the project and CI workflow. GitHub Pages cannot run this Python backend, so publishing the repository alone is not a full-stack live deployment. See GitHub Pages documentation.

Docker:

$env:JWT_SECRET_KEY='your-generated-random-secret'
docker compose up --build
Open http://localhost:8000. The named volume preserves SQLite data. The Docker image refuses the default/short JWT secret in production.

For free hosting, follow FREE_HOSTING.md. The included Render blueprint uses a Free web service and a separate free Neon PostgreSQL database. It creates no paid disk or paid service. You need to sign up/sign in to those services yourself. The database connection string belongs in Render's secret environment settings.

Free hosting may sleep after inactivity and has usage limits. A live internet URL is available only after you complete that deployment. Keep SQLite for local use or Docker Compose with its local volume; do not use ephemeral SQLite for durable online accounts/tickets.

Data and review
Project review
Location source: NIC Integrated Government Online Directory
Refresh location snapshot: python scripts/refresh_locations.py (network required; checks all state counts before replacing files).
The supplied scheme CSV, eligibility rules, notebooks and model assets are retained from the team's archive. Their full provenance, reuse rights, freshness and accuracy require team verification before a public launch.
No Git history was included in the ZIP. Preserve the original group attribution when publishing or linking the original team repository.
